    <p>* (One Full Meal For Pregnant and Lactating Women At The Anganwadi Centre)
An implementation of ICDS has resulted in improvementof the nutritional status of women 
and children in the state, the desired goal shave not been achieved.The percentage of low 
birth weight babies, underweight children (<3 years) and pregnant women who are anaemic
is still high. As a result, reduction of Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Rate 
(MMR) continues to be a challenge.</p>

<p>* Scientific evidence shows that malnutrition starts early in life and its effects become 
irreversible after 2-3 years. Meeting the nutritional needs of Pregnant & Lactating women
is therefore one of the critical windows of opportunity available to prevent malnutrition. 
Hence a need was felt to modify the nutrition programme of ICDS especially as the Take 
Home Ration (THR) provided to Pregnant and Lactating women under ICDS is not only too 
meagre but also gets shared by all members of the family.</p>

<p>* In this regard, the State Government introduced ArogyaLaxmi Programme which involves spot feeding of “one full meal” for Pregnant and Lactating women at the Anganwadi centre along with administration of Iron & Folic Acid (IFA) tablet. The programme was started on 01.01.2013 in ICDS Projects with most adverse health and nutrition indicators
After state bifurcation 2015 onwards it was scaled up in 149 ICDS (100 %). ICDS Projects. 
Projects covering 31,897 Main AWCs and 4,076 Mini Anganwadi Centers in Telangana State. 
The one full meal consists of Rice, Dal with leafy Vegetables/sambar, vegetables for a minimum 
of 25 days, boiled Egg and 200ml. milk for 30 days in a month.  The one full meal will meet
40-45% of the daily calorie and 40-45% of protein and calcium requirement per day of the 
pregnant and lactating mothers. Along with the meal, Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablet is to be 
administered. For children between 7 months to 3 years are providing 16 Eggs per month 
where as children from 3-6 years were providing 30 Eggs per month.</p>

<h2>Objectives of “Arogya Laxmi programme”</h2>
<p>
1) Enhance the quality and acceptability of supplementary nutrition by the Pregnant and 
Lactating women.<br>
2) Ensure food supplied is consumed by only the Pregnant and Lactating women rather 
than the whole family.<br>
3) Ensurethat Pregnant and Lactating women consume 90+ IFAtablets.<br>
4) Improve the enrollment of mothers at AnganwadiCenters (AWCs).<br>
5) Eliminate or decrease number of Pregnant and Lactating women with anaemia/ who are 
undernourished.<br>
6) Reduce the incidence of low birth babies and malnutrition among children.<br>
7) Ensure that Pregnant and Lactating women receive health check ups and immunization.<br>
8) Reduce the incidence of infant mortality and maternal mortality.</p>

<h2>Operational guidelines for Arogya Laxmi programme</h2>

Full Meal Programme for improving nutritional status among Pregnant and Lactating 
Women and to reduce low birth weight and mortality of infants and children under 6 years.</p>
