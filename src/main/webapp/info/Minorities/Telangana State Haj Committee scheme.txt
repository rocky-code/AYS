The Telangana State Haj Committee is gearing up for the Haj pilgrimage 2020 
	     and aims to ensure a hassle free departure of pilgrims for the holy journey 
	scheduled in mid-2020.

		Sharing the plans for the coming pilgrimage, Mohd Masiullah Khan, Chairman, 
	     Telangana State Haj Committee, tells Telangana Today that all arrangements are 
	being put in place to ensure zero-inconvenience for the pilgrims.

* <b>What are the plans TS Haj Committee have for Haj pilgrimage 2020 :-</b>

          Around 5,000 persons from Telangana are likely to depart from Haj House at 
	  Hyderabad. We plan to provide them the best of facilities in terms of accommodation
	  and arrange for customs and immigration clearance at the Haj House. A series of 
	  coordination meetings will be held with different stakeholders involved in the 
	  Haj camp to ensure 'zero-inconvenience' to the pilgrims.

* <b>How do they plan to educate pilgrims on rituals of pilgrimage :-</b>

          Haj Training Camps will be held across the State tentatively from March 2020. 
	  Religious scholars will deliver lectures and explain to the intended Haj pilgrims
	  about various religious aspects of the pilgrimage. Those going through private 
	  tour operators too can attend these camps.

* <b>Seats been provided to Telangana State Haj Committee by Central Haj Committee :-</b>

          The State Haj Committee was allocated a quota of 4,169 seats during Haj 
	  pilgrimage 2019. In a week from now, we will get the quota for Haj pilgrimage 
	  -2020 and we expect that the State will get more seats compared to last pilgrimage.

* <b>The chances for a State getting additional quota :-</b>

          We expect a few hundred more seats to be allocated to the State to accommodate 
	  the pilgrims in waiting category. The seats not filled in other States will be 
	  distributed to States where there is a demand. Last year 1,000 pilgrims who were 
	  in the waiting list got a chance after Telangana got additional quota.

* <b>Pilgrims applied for pilgrimage 2020 :- </b>

          We have received 10,613 applications. Of these 10,143 pertain to general category, 
	  462 to reserved category for above 70 years and remaining for eight reserved 
          category of women above age of 45 years.
