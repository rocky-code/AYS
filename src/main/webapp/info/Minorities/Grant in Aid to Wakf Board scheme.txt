The finance department in Hyderabad has cleared Rs 35 crore towards grant-in-aid to the Wakf Board.

This was pending for a long time. A Wakf Board official said that the delay in the release of funds had affected the execution
of several schemes.

	'Scheme could not even disburse monthly financial assistance to divorcees since 
	November,'  Telangana state Wakf Board said.

		The board disburses Rs 5.10 lakh per month to 339 divorced women who 
	were awarded a decree by the magistrate in accordance with the Wakf Act.

		The Wakf Board could not pay the enhanced honorariums announced for imams and 
	muezzins last year due to the election code of conduct and lack of funds.

		The Haj Committee received Rs 80 lakh last week, said sources.

		The state government has allocated Rs 4 crore of which it has received 
	Rs 1.8 crore so far.

		The Urdu Academy has received a total of Rs 5 crore out of the grant of
	Rs 40 crore. This year funds were allotted for the construction of the 
	Urdu Ghar-cum-community hall.

		The Telangana State Minorities Corporation received Rs 18.86 crore towards
	bank-linked subsidy schemes while Rs 21.14 crore is pending with the treasury.
	Government allocated Rs 160 crore for the scheme which drew more than 1.25 lakh
	applications.

	The authorities are contemplating calling for fresh applications as the validity
	of the income certificates has lapsed.

	Corporation managing director Waheed Ahmed said that such applicants would be given
	priority while selecting candidates.
