Hyderabad: 

The century-old Shahi Masjid at Public Garden is under threat. 
Cracks have been found at various places in the structure. In Telangana 
		only two mosques - Mecca Masjid and Shahi Masjid - are under the direct 	
		management of the state government.

				The construction of the mosque was started by the 
		City Improve-ment Board in 1924 on the instructions of the VII 
		Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan, and it was completed in 1933. The minarets,
		columns, domes and arches of the mosque are very much in the royal 
		style of architecture. Two Niyaz Khanas were built on both sides of 
		the Masjid. The Nizam and his courtiers used to perform Juma prayer in 
		this Masjid.
	 

	The Minorities Welfare Department is responsible for maintenance of the mosque.
	While the Government spends crores of rupees on the preservation and restoration 
	of the Mecca Masjid, which is also in its charge, it has ignored the Shahi Masjid.

				Musallis or caretakers of the Masjid complain that the 
	government does not release money to restore the mosque nor does it allow them to 
	carry out the repairs. Mohammed Younus, a musallis of the Masjid said, 
	'Major cracks have developed in the domes, minarets and roof that cause water 
	seepage during the rains. The whole structure will collapse soon if it is not 
	repaired immediately. We are unable to pray in the cortile of the Masjid in the 
	summer or in the rainy season due to the broken sunshade.'

	The construction order was handed over to Laxmi Hericon on August 16. 
	'Senior executives from the company and department officials visited the mosque 
	on the same day,' said Ms N.R. Visalatchy,  director of the department of
	archaeology and museums.
	
	Last year, the department carried out technical works, including studying the 
	seasonal reaction of the structure and identified repair works.
